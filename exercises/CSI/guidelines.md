# Pattern matching application example (CSI)

You have been assigned by the Department of Scientific Investigations to analyze the DNA discovered in 3 unsolved cases and compare it with that of 3 suspects to reveal the culprit.

Everything needed to implement a program that solves the problem has been acquired through programming, algorithms, and data structures courses: creating classes, overriding methods, making a class executable, reading from files, analyzing strings, using loops, including nested ones, and making decisions with if statements.

## Background

DNA, the carrier of genetic information in living organisms, has been used in scientific investigations for decades. But how exactly does DNA profiling work? Given a DNA sample, how do forensic investigators manage to identify to whom it belongs?
DNA is actually composed of a sequence of molecules, called nucleotides, that form a double helix. Each DNA nucleotide contains one of four bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T). Every human cell contains billions of these nucleotides arranged in sequence. Some portions of this sequence, known as the genome, are the same or very similar in all humans. However, other parts of the sequence have higher genetic diversity and therefore vary among individuals of the same species. One of the places where DNA tends to have high genetic diversity is in Short Tandem Repeats (STRs). An STR is a short DNA sequence that tends to repeat multiple times consecutively. The number of times a particular STR repeats varies greatly among different individuals. For example, in the image below, Alice has the STR "AGAT" repeated 4 times in her DNA, while Bob has the same STR repeated 5 times.
