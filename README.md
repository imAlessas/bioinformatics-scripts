## Generate data

To try the [algorithms](/algorithms/) without having any type of data you can randomly generate them using the [```generate.cpp```](/algorithms/data-folder/generator.cpp) file. After its execution, it will create different sequences (up to 3.2 billion characters) and patterns. Note that its execution may take some time and memory: the empirical values are ~15 minutes for the execution and ~4GB of storage. If you want to customize or add other data files, it is suggested to save them in the dedicated folder.
